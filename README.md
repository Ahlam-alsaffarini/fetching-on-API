## Overview

### The challenge

using the "Dummy Json" apis....
you should create two pages:
Page One : to display all the produst using the api.
Page Two : to display the product details that provided for each one.

This a challenge for build a product page using "Dummy Json" apis , the user should able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.
- display all the produst on page.
  -display the product details that provided for each one on other page.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- booststrap
- js
- Dummy json

### What I learned

When I first started learning JavaScript it used to be very a hard to understand how to interact with DOM elements.but it's getting easier with time ,and I am happy to practice on this challenge !

yeah it's still some of my working on proj not a professional ,but I hope in the future to become stronger and more creative in writing codes ^-^
